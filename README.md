# Roadmap

This repository hosts the [public roadmap][internal-url] of
[VAST](https://vast.io) in the form of a [GitHub Project][github-projects].

## Structure

The roadmap works as follows:

- The official roadmap URL <https://vast.io/roadmap> links to the
  organization-wide [GitHub Project][internal-url] board.

- [Issues](issues) represent the individual roadmap items.

- The referenced [Project][internal-url] embeds issues from this repository.

- [Labels](labels) categorize the roadmap items.

- [Milestones](milestones) group roadmap items into overarching themes.

## Engagement

By opening our roadmap, we want to include the community in the planning.
Our introductory [blog post][roadmap-post] explains the rationale in more depth.
