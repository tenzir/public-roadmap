This repository hosts the [public roadmap][internal-url] of
[VAST](https://vast.io) in the form of a [GitHub Project][github-projects].

## Structure

The roadmap works as follows:

- The official roadmap URL <https://vast.io/roadmap> links to the
  organization-wide [GitHub Project][internal-url] board.

- [Issues](issues) represent the individual roadmap items.

- The referenced [Project][internal-url] embeds issues from this repository.

- [Labels](labels) categorize the roadmap items.

- [Milestones](milestones) group roadmap items into overarching themes.

## Engagement

By opening our roadmap, we want to include the community in the planning.
Our introductory [blog post][roadmap-post] explains the rationale in more depth.

If you have a *general* question about the roadmap, reach out to us on
[Slack][slack] or start a [GitHub Discussion][discussions]. For *specific*
question about a roadmap item, leave a comment to spawn a discussion.

If you would like to get deeper involved, take a look at our [RFC process][rfc].
Approved RFCs become a first-class roadmap item, yet remain—like all roadmap
items—subject to scheduling and resource constraints.

## Disclaimer

By sharing our roadmap, we want to establish transparency and seek engagement.
Our objective is not to provide a binding commitment, with respect to timeline
or sequencing, but rather establish a communication vehicle.

Roadmap changes may occur any time without notification.
