This repository hosts the [public roadmap][internal-url] of
[Tenzir](https://tenzir.com) in the form of a [GitHub Project][github-projects].

## Structure

The roadmap works as follows:

- The official roadmap URL <https://docs.tenzir.com/roadmap> links to the
  organization-wide [GitHub Project][internal-url] board.

- [Issues][issues] represent the individual roadmap items.

- The referenced [Project][internal-url] embeds issues from this repository.

- [Labels][labels] categorize the roadmap items.

## Engagement

We want to include the community in our planning process, especially with
respect to upcoming features. Our introductory [blog post][roadmap-post]
explains the rationale in more depth.

If you have a *general* question about the roadmap, reach out to us on
[Discord][discord] or start a [GitHub Discussion][discussions]. For *specific*
question about a particular roadmap item, please leave a comment.

## Disclaimer

By sharing our roadmap, we want to establish transparency and seek engagement.
Our objective is not to provide a binding commitment, with respect to timeline
or sequencing, but rather establish a communication vehicle.

Roadmap changes may occur any time without notification.
